OBJECTIVE:

Self-care may be defined by the term itself – caring for yourself. 
Although prioritizing self-care may sound like common sense, especially if you’re considering longevity, it’s often the first thing to go when we find ourselves in challenging situations. 
This is why it is important to keep it top of mind and not an afterthought, especially when we find ourselves in challenging times.
So the main objective is to make sure the atmosphere among the students is enhanced and served in healthy-manner.
